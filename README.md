# d3_health_risks_visualization

Exploring the health risks facing particular demographics Using D3. This project uses information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The included data is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

Created a D3 interactive chart to demonstrate the correlations between the different measures.
