          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The data shows that there is a definite correlation between income, age and smoking. 
            As income decreases smoking tendencies tend to increase. It seems also the preponderance of the smoking habit is in the southern US.
            Obesity also shows a correlation but only a 15% increase in obesity between the lowest median incomes and the hisghest. 
            The correlation is there not quite as remarkable as the relation between smoking and income.</p>

          <p>It seems there is a correlation between median incomes per capita and level of health coverage. MA seems to have 
            one of the highest per capita median incomes with the lowest incidence of people with out healthcare. MS has the lowest 
            per capita income of all the states and a high incidence of people wihtout healthcare. TX has a middling income per capita 
            but the highest incidence of non health coverage. This probably has to do with politics of the state in general.</p>
